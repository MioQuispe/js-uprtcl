## Running

Clone the [eth-uprtcl](https://github.com/uprtcl/eth-uprtcl) to have the Ethereum backend provider running in localhost.

1. Run `ganache-cli` locally:

- If you don't have `ganache-cli` installed, run: `npm install -g ganache-cli`.
- Run in the background: `ganache-cli`.

2. Go inside that folder, and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
```
